        Hello! My name is Mehdi and I enjoy building user interfaces on the web.
        My interest in web development was sparked by Harvard's CS50:
        Introduction to Computer Science course. Messing around with basic HTML
        & CSS was a lot of fun and intrigued me to learn more.
      </p>
      <p>Here are some technologies I feel comfortable working with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>TypeScript</li>
        <li>React</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
